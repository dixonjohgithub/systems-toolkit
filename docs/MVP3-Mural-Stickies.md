# MVP3 — Mural Sticky Notes
## System-Level Framing: Agile Artifact Generation as Delivery Governance

---

## 🟥 CLUSTER 1 — The Core Problem Statement
*Red stickies — problem framing*

1. Artifact compliance is assessed after the work is designed — at the most expensive possible moment.
2. Non-compliant artifacts are not caught at creation. They are caught mid-sprint, at governance audit, or at a process gate — when correction is most disruptive.
3. The compliance standard exists. Its application is inconsistent because static templates cannot encode the specific requirements for each work type.
4. The cost of non-compliance compounds with every sprint that passes between creation and discovery. MVP3 eliminates the gap by making compliance the output condition, not the review condition.

## 🟨 CLUSTER 2 — The Visibility Asymmetry
*Yellow stickies — why it persists*

5. Artifact creation happens under delivery pressure. Engineers and PMs translate approved intakes into Jira stories manually — close to compliant, but not fully compliant.
6. No one flags non-compliance at creation time because no one is watching. The artifact enters the backlog. Sprint planning proceeds. Work begins.
7. The compliance gap surfaces mid-execution — requiring teams to reconstruct context from decisions made weeks earlier and reopen planning agreements both sides thought were settled.
8. At the portfolio level, mid-sprint artifact correction appears in the data as delivery variance — not as an artifact quality problem. The root cause is invisible.
9. Two product managers applying the same template to the same intake will produce artifacts with different field completeness, different acceptance criteria, different dependency coverage. Inconsistency is built into the manual process.
10. Better templates do not solve this. A static template cannot encode the specific compliance requirements for each work type, portfolio position, and regulatory classification.

## 🟦 CLUSTER 3 — What Manual Artifact Creation Actually Costs
*Blue stickies — the real resource impact*

11. Manual artifact creation is translation, not design. The information required for a compliant Epic already exists in the validated intake. Engineers and PMs are re-entering structured data the system already holds.
12. The cost of correcting a non-compliant artifact scales with how far into delivery the correction happens. At sprint planning — a conversation. At sprint execution — an interruption. At audit — a reopened planning decision with downstream consequences.
13. Non-compliant artifacts create planning uncertainty. A story without complete acceptance criteria means the team is planning against an incomplete specification. The gap surfaces during execution.
14. In regulated industries, non-compliant artifacts are an audit exposure — difficult to quantify but impossible to ignore. The compliance gap is not in the process. It is in the artifacts the process produces.
15. Engineering and product management time spent correcting artifacts mid-sprint is delivery capacity that should be applied to delivery. It appears as normal overhead. It is actually a governance failure.
16. The pattern is predictable and preventable: the further compliance correction happens from the creation event, the more expensive it is. MVP3 moves correction to before creation — where the cost approaches zero.

## 🟩 CLUSTER 4 — The Portfolio Governance Frame
*Green stickies — executive reframe*

17. By the time a submission reaches MVP3, the system already has everything a compliant artifact needs. MVP0 validated the data. MVP1 established portfolio position. MVP2 classified the work type. Generating the artifact is the natural final step.
18. MVP3 is not adding a new capability. It is producing the output of a process that has been accumulating the right data since the first question of the intake conversation.
19. Compliant artifacts at creation time are a compound investment. Every artifact generated correctly is an artifact that will not require mid-sprint correction, will not create planning uncertainty, and will not generate audit exposure.
20. The governance argument for MVP3 is not efficiency — it is risk elimination. Non-compliant artifacts are a delivery risk and, in regulated environments, a liability.
21. MVP3 closes the loop between intake governance and delivery governance. Quality established at intake. Portfolio integrity established at duplicate detection. Strategic alignment established at classification. Execution artifacts compliant at generation.
22. The correction cost does not move downstream. It disappears.

## 🟧 CLUSTER 5 — One-Liners by Audience
*Orange stickies — how to say it in the room*

23. TO AN EXECUTIVE: "Non-compliant artifacts are a mid-sprint risk that appears in your data as delivery variance. MVP3 eliminates the root cause before the sprint begins."
24. TO A VP: "Your teams are spending engineering and PM time re-entering data the system already has, producing artifacts that are inconsistently compliant and expensive to correct. MVP3 automates the mechanical part so delivery focus stays on delivery."
25. TO A PROGRAM MANAGER: "Every non-compliant artifact in your portfolio is a future interruption waiting to happen. MVP3 means every artifact that enters the backlog is compliant at creation — not corrected mid-execution."
26. TO A REVIEWER / SCRUM MASTER: "The Epic and stories are generated for you — populated from the validated intake, tagged by work type, linked to portfolio dependencies. Sprint planning starts from a compliant artifact, not a template."

## ⬜ CLUSTER 6 — The Anchor Statement
*White sticky — pin to center of the board*

27. "Right now, the translation from approved intake to Jira artifact is manual, inconsistent, and unvalidated. Engineers and product managers re-enter structured data the system already holds, applying static templates that cannot encode the specific compliance requirements for each work type. The result is artifacts that are consistently close to compliant — but not fully compliant — and the gap surfaces mid-sprint, at the highest possible correction cost. MVP3 closes the loop. The intake data is already collected, validated, classified, and positioned against the portfolio. Generating a compliant artifact from that data is the final step of a process that has been building toward it since submission. The correction cost does not move downstream — it disappears."
