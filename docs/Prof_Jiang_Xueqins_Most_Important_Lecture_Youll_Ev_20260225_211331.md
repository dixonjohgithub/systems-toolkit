## TL;DR

> Prof. Jiang argues that power is structural, not psychological: access comes from becoming systemically necessary through clear signal, cognitive parity, discretion, and long-term performance—not networking, charm, or desperate outreach.

---

## Key Points

### 1. Power is structural: it comes from bottlenecks and systemic relevance

Power emerges from positions where decisions, resources, or coordination must pass through—i.e., bottlenecks in networks and institutions. People gain influence because the system depends on their role, not because they are charismatic, likable, or uniquely talented. To understand power, you must think in terms of networks, flows, and constraints rather than personalities.

### 2. Powerful people filter aggressively because attention—not opportunity—is scarce

The core constraint for people near power is attention; they experience constant inbound requests, urgency, and emotional pressure. They rely on fast, often unconscious filters that work like spam detection, sorting others as signal or noise within seconds. Trying harder (extra follow-ups, louder appeals) frequently backfires because it confirms that you do not understand the filtering system.

### 3. Signal beats noise: communicate with clarity, specificity, and system awareness

Noise looks like vague intent (“pick your brain”), emotional appeals (“my passion”), and generic ambition (“make a difference”). Signal looks like clear roles, specific metrics, precise asks, and awareness of constraints and trade-offs. The same request can be discarded or accepted depending on whether it is framed as measurable, context-aware information rather than hype.

### 4. Dependency repels power; completeness attracts it

The fastest way to trigger rejection is to show up dependent—signaling urgency, over-availability, or a need for validation. Power interprets dependency as instability and future obligation, so it closes the door as risk management. The alternative is to show up “complete”: able to move forward without them, while making clear how their involvement would accelerate outcomes.

### 5. Access comes from cognitive parity and systems language, not conventional networking

Power operates laterally by seeking people who share its level of abstraction—those who understand incentives, constraints, and second-order effects. Cognitive parity is not raw intelligence; it is shared mental models and the ability to anticipate downstream consequences. You demonstrate parity through systems language (incentives, trade-offs, feedback loops) rather than moralizing or emotional framing, which often reads as naïve or unstable in high-stakes contexts.

### 6. Elite signals: time horizon, restraint, timing, and tolerance for silence

Elite thinking emphasizes feedback loops and second-order consequences, because leverage compounds outcomes over time. Restraint signals abundance and discretion: say only what is necessary, do not over-explain, and do not chase validation when power goes silent. Timing is contextual intelligence—good ideas fail when delivered too early, too late, or during mismatched organizational priorities.

### 7. Be an option creator, not a helper: indirect value creates enduring relevance

Power does not primarily want “helpers” who execute defined tasks; it wants people who expand strategic options, reduce uncertainty, and synthesize across domains. Indirect value includes connecting disparate fields, translating complexity into action, and anticipating conflicts before they surface. This shifts relationships from transactional labor to durable network relevance.

### 8. Structural inevitability is the real path: shared environments, reputation, discretion, and time

Meaningful access usually forms through shared problem-solving environments (projects, boards, crisis teams, working groups), not cold outreach or introductions. Power prioritizes predictability, discretion, and stability because inclusion increases risk, leakage, and coordination costs. Over time, consistent performance and reputation make you “structurally inevitable”—your exclusion becomes costly—so access becomes required rather than granted.

---

## Conclusion

The lecture reframes power as a structural phenomenon driven by bottlenecks, attention constraints, and risk management rather than personality, charm, or status performance. To gain access, you must communicate as signal, avoid dependency, and demonstrate cognitive parity through systems thinking and second-order reasoning. Prof. Jiang emphasizes restraint, discretion, timing, and reputation as core selection mechanisms, arguing that cold outreach and conventional networking usually fail because they bypass filters. The durable strategy is to become structurally inevitable by building real capabilities, creating options, and solving consequential problems in shared environments until the system must include you.

In every society, people rise or fall not because of talent, but because of the system shaping their thinking. If you don't understand these systems, you will spend your life reacting to forces you didn't even know were controlling you. Watch this to the end, because this lecture gives you the one framework that explains power, education, decline, and why the world works the way it does. And why you must see it clearly now, right? Let me start with something that's going to sound harsh, but I need you to hear it because if you don't get this right from the beginning, nothing else we talk about is going to help you. Most people approach power completely wrong. They treat it like it's a psychology problem, like it's about getting inside someone's head. So they ask questions like, what do powerful people think? What makes them tick? How can I impress them? What should I wear to the meeting? How do I make them like me? And this entire framing, this whole way of thinking about it, is already incorrect. If you start on the wrong premise, it doesn't matter how hard you work or how smart you are, you're building on a broken foundation. So here's what you need to understand, and this is fundamental. Power is not primarily psychological. It's structural. Now what does that actually mean? Let me break it down for you. It means power emerges from your position inside systems. We're talking about institutions, capital flows, decision bottlenecks, course of capacity. Therefore, and this is the key, access to power is not governed by likability or charisma or how well you tell stories at dinner parties. It's governed by something called systemic relevance. Think about a circuit breaker in your house. That circuit breaker has power not because it's charismatic, not because it went to the right school, but because electricity flows through it. If that circuit breaker fails, everything downstream stops working. That's structural power. The same exact principle applies to humans in complex systems. Certain people become powerful because decisions must pass through them. Resources get routed through them or coordination depends on them. Not because they're smarter or better or more deserving, but because they occupy bottleneck positions in the network. So before we go any further, I need you to make a mental shift right now. Stop thinking about power as a personality trait. Start thinking about it as a position in a network. Once you make that shift, everything else follows. Now let's dig into what actually creates power in the first place. Because once you understand this, you'll start seeing it everywhere. Power exists wherever there is a bottleneck. That's it. That's the whole game right there. A person becomes powerful not because they dominate others, not because they're brilliant, not because they went to Harvard, though those things might help. They become powerful because decisions must pass through them. Resources are routed through them or coordination depends on them. Let me give you a concrete example so you can see how this actually works. Think about a movie production. Who has the most power on set? You might think it's a director, right? Or maybe the lead actor. And sometimes it is. But often it's actually whoever controls the bottleneck resource at that particular moment. So if you're shooting a location that requires city permits, the permit coordinator has enormous power that week. Not because they're important in the abstract, not because they have a fancy title, but because nothing can happen until they solve that specific problem. They're the bottleneck. Remove them and everything stops. Now, the same principle skills all the way up. A Federal Reserve chair has power because interest rate decisions flow through that office. A Supreme Court justice has power because legal interpretation flows through them. A venture capitalist has power because capital allocation flows through them. And here's what this means for how powerful people actually experience the world. And this is really important to understand. Their primary constraint is not opportunity. Think about that. They have endless opportunities, more opportunities than they could possibly pursue. Their primary constraint is attention. Think about your own life. When you're not very busy, you can respond to almost anyone who reaches out to you. Right? You got time. You can be generous with your attention. But when you're overwhelmed, when you're at capacity, you start filtering aggressively. You ignore most messages. You prioritize ruthlessly. You have to or you would never get anything done. Now, imagine that as your permanent state. That's what power feels like from the inside every single day. So, here's something that most people completely don't grasp about powerful individuals. They live in a totally different attention economy than you do. It's like they're operating in a different universe. And most people, they compete for attention by becoming louder, more visible, more insistent. They think the problem is that they're not being heard. So, the solution must be to speak up more, to be more persistent, to really make themselves known. But here's the thing. Power does the opposite. Power survives by filtering. Let me paint you a picture of what this actually looks like. Every single day, powerful individuals are subjected to an absolutely overwhelming barrage. We're talking about requests, narratives, emotional appeals, moral pressure, and what I call urgency theater. Everyone wants something. Everyone has a crisis. Everyone needs a response right now. So, what happens? They develop aggressive internal filters that operate below consciousness. These aren't conscious decisions. These are survival mechanisms that they develop over time. They have to have them or they literally cannot function. Now, here's what you need to understand. You are not being evaluated on your merit as a human being. You're being sorted mechanically the same way your spam filter sorts email. It's not personal. It's algorithmic. And most of that sorting happens in seconds, sometimes milliseconds. Before the powerful person has consciously decided anything about you, before they've even thought about who you are, their filters have already made a decision. This is why, and I need you to really hear this, this is why trying harder often makes things worse. When you send a follow-up email, you're not demonstrating persistence. You're confirming that you don't understand a filtering system. You're proving that you can't read contacts. Let me be very clear about what this means in practical terms. When a powerful person doesn't respond to you, it's usually not personal. They didn't sit there thinking, who is this person? Are they worthy of my time? Let me carefully consider their request. They didn't think about you at all. You were filtered out before conscious thought even happened. So the question, and this is the real question, the question is not how do I make them pay attention to me? The question is how do I avoid triggering the filters in the first place? All right? So let's talk about the most important distinction that power makes. This is the first filter, and it's the one that catches most people. The distinction is between noise and signal. Now this happens so fast that most people don't even realize they've been categorized. But once you're being tagged as noise, it's almost impossible to recover. You're done. The door is closed. So what's the difference? Let me break this down for you very specifically. Noise sounds like this, and pay attention because you might recognize yourself here. Noise is vague intent, like I love to pick your brain. It's emotional language like this is my passion. It's generic ambition, like I want to make a difference. It's unstructured intelligence, like I have some interesting ideas. Signal sounds completely different. Signal is clarity of role, like I run S, which says Y.
 It's precise language with specific terms. No filler, no fluff. It's system awareness, like given the constraints you're facing. It's proportional behavior that's appropriate to the context you're in. Now, here's what's brutal about this, and I need you to really understand this. Most people think they're sending signal when they're actually broadcasting noise. The gap between your self-perception and their filtering system is where most opportunities die. Let me give you a specific example so you can see the difference clearly. Someone emails a venture capitalist, and they write, I have a revolutionary app idea that's going to change everything. I just need funding to get started. Can we need for coffee to discuss? Now, every single element of that message is noise. Revolutionary is noise. Change everything is noise. Just need funding is noise. Coffee to discuss is noise. The whole thing is just noise stacked on top of more noise. Here's what signal would sound like for the same goal. Listen to the difference. We build a beta with 10,000 active users. Retention is 65% at day 30. Looking to raise a $2 million seed round. Are you investing in consumer social right now? Same goal, same person, completely different filtering result. The person sending noise genuinely believes they're being impressive. They think they're showing passion and vision. They don't understand they've already been discarded. Let me tell you about the absolute fastest way to repel power. And I mean the fastest way. If you do this, you're done before you even start. Show up dependent. Nothing, and I mean nothing, triggers rejection faster than dependency. Now, how does dependency announce itself? Let me give you the signs because you need to recognize them. It's urgency, like I really need this opportunity. It's over availability, like I'm available whenever it works for you. It's implicit need for validation, like this would mean everything to me. It's requests without leverage, like I'd be so grateful for your help. Now, you think you're saying these things, you think you're being humble. You think you're being appreciative and respectful. But here's what power hears. Power hears instability. Why? Because dependency creates obligation. And obligation is a form of emotional debt that powerful people guard against instinctively. They've learned this over time. Let me explain what's happening beneath the surface here. When you signal dependency, you're communicating something very specific. You're saying, my stability depends on your response. And that makes the powerful person responsible for your emotional state. And they didn't sign up for that responsibility. They don't want it. Now, this is not cruelty. I need you to understand that this is risk management. Because powerful people have learned through experience that dependency spirals. It never stays contained. One favor creates expectation of a second favor. One introduction creates expectation of ongoing access. One encouraging word creates expectation of full mentorship. So they've learned to shut it down immediately. At the first sign of dependency, the door closes. And here's the paradox, and this is brutal, but you need to hear it. The more you need something, the less likely you are to get it. The less you need it, the more freely it flows. This is why desperate people stay desperate. Their desperation is precisely what prevents them from getting what they need. It's a vicious cycle. So what's the alternative? How do you show up instead? You show up complete. Not arrogant, there's a difference, but complete. You have a viable path forward, whether they help you or not. Their participation would accelerate that path, but it's not essential to your survival. That changes everything. Now, let's talk about networking, because most networking advice is complete garbage. And I need to explain why. Conventional networking advice assumes something very specific. It assumes symmetrical relationships. It assumes mutual curiosity, social reciprocity, and roughly equal status. It assumes that if you're interesting enough and charming enough and persistent enough, you'll eventually build a relationship. And you know what? That's fine for peer relationships. That works when you're networking with people at your level. But it's completely wrong for power. It doesn't apply at all. Because power operates under asymmetry. Think about what this means. A powerful person does not need new people. They already have more people than they can possibly manage. They're drowning in people. What they need is new capabilities. Let me say that again, because it's crucial and most people miss this. They don't need new people. They need new capabilities. Networking teaches you to perform, to be memorable, to send thank you notes, to follow up, to stay in touch, to maintain relationships. Power doesn't care about any of that. Power selects for function. Think about how you choose tools in your own life. You don't choose a hammer because it has a nice personality, right? You choose it because it drives nails. The same exact principle applies here. This is why all the networking advice about building authentic relationships and adding value and being genuinely interested in them, all of that is well-intentioned but structurally irrelevant. Now, it's not that authenticity doesn't matter. It does matter, but authenticity is table stakes. It's not a differentiator. Everyone trying to access power is being authentic. Everyone is trying to add value. Everyone is genuinely interested. So the question, the real question is this. What function do you serve that isn't already being served? If you can't answer that question precisely, you don't have a networking problem. You have a positioning problem. And no amount of networking events or coffee meetings is going to fix a positioning problem. Most people approach powerful individuals thinking, how do I get them to like me? That's a wrong question entirely. The right question is, what systemic problem do I solve that they currently have no good solution for? So most people approach power vertically, and I want to explain what I mean by that and why it's wrong. They ask, how do I reach someone above me? It's a hierarchical question. How do I climb the ladder? How do I get to the next level? This is understandable. It makes intuitive sense, but it's ineffective because power thinks laterally. Power asks a completely different question. Who else is operating at my level of abstraction? Now let me explain what I mean by level of abstraction because this is really important. Imagine three people looking at a forest. Same forest, same moment in time. One person sees trees, just individual trees. One person sees an ecosystem. They're seeing the relationships between the trees, the soil, the wildlife. One person sees a carbon sink with implications for climate policy. They're seeing global systems. They're looking at the exact same forest, but they operate at different levels of abstraction. And here's the thing. They literally cannot understand each other without translation. They're seeing different things when they look at the same reality. Now here's what's critical, and this is where most people get it wrong. Hierarchy matters far less than cognitive parity. Think about what that means. A CEO cares less about your job title than whether you understand the system the same way they do. They'd rather talk to a mid-level analyst who gets it than a senior executive who doesn't because the mid-level analyst can think at the same level of complexity and a senior executive can't. This is why some young people have extraordinary access while experienced professionals get locked out. It's not about credentials. It's not about years of experience. It's about shared mental models. When you think vertically, you're trying to.
 climb a ladder. When you think laterally, you're trying to find your cognitive peers regardless of where they sit in the hierarchy. This completely changes your strategy. Instead of asking, how do I impress them? You ask, how do I demonstrate that I see what they see? Instead of trying to get a meeting with someone senior, you participate in the spaces where people at your level of abstraction naturally gather. You write in public. You solve problems. You make your thinking visible. And then power finds you because you've demonstrated cognitive parity. Let's dig into what cognitive parity actually means because this is where most people get confused and it's absolutely critical. Cognitive parity is not about being smart. I need to be clear about that. Plenty of smart people have zero access to power. Intelligence alone doesn't get you there. Cognitive parity means something very specific. It means understanding the system the same way, seeing the same constraints, anticipating the same second-order effects. It's about shared mental models, not IQ, completely different thing. Let me give you a concrete example so you can see the difference. Imagine you're talking to someone who runs a large organization. You suggest a policy change. You think it's a good idea. It makes sense for you. They immediately respond with three downstream effects you hadn't even considered, effects that involve legal liability, employee morale, and regulatory compliance. Now, you didn't lack intelligence. You are a smart person. What you lack was the mental model. You are operating at a different level of system complexity. You weren't seeing the whole chessboard. Now, imagine a different conversation. Same person, same policy suggestion, but this time you've only thought through those three downstream effects. You address them before they're even raised. You show that you're modeling the same complexity they are. That person immediately recognizes you, not emotionally. This isn't about liking you. Structurally, they think, okay, this person sees what I see. They can be trusted to operate in this environment without constant supervision. And this is how access actually happens, not through charm, not through persistence, but through demonstrated cognitive parity. And here's what's beautiful about this. It can't be faked. You can fake charisma. You can fake credentials, but you cannot fake actually understanding the system. The gaps in your understanding become visible the moment you start talking. When you speak from inside the same mental model, power recognizes you immediately. Not because they like you, not because you impressed them with your resume, but because you've demonstrated that you're operating at the same level of abstraction. This is why the fastest path to power is not networking. It's developing increasingly sophisticated mental models of how complex systems actually work. Now we're going to talk about language, because language is how cognitive parity becomes visible to other people. It's how they can tell whether you're thinking at their level or not. Power communicates in what I call systems language always. What does systems language mean? It means talking about incentives, trade-offs, constraints, and downstream consequences. When you speak in moral language, you sound naive, even if you're making a moral point, even if you're right. When you speak in emotional language, you sound unstable, even if your emotions are completely valid. Systems language signals competence without self-promotion. It just doesn't work for you. Let me show you the difference. Same idea, different language, completely different effect. Moral language says we should help these people because it's the right thing to do. Systems language says the cost of non-intervention creates downstream instability that's more expensive to manage than upfront investment. Now both sentences might be arguing for the exact same action. You might end up in the same place, but they signal completely different levels of sophistication. The moral argument assumes the listener shares your values. The systems argument assumes they care about consequences, and power always cares about consequences. That's the world they live in. Here's another example so you can really see this. Emotional language says this is an exciting opportunity that I'm really passionate about. Systems language says this creates optionality in three markets we're currently locked out of. Same enthusiasm underneath completely different effect on filtering systems. The person using emotional language sounds like they need validation. The person using systems language sounds like they understand strategic positioning. Now I'm not saying you should never be moral or emotional. I'm not saying feelings don't matter. I'm saying that when you're communicating with power, lead with systems language. Establish that you understand how the system works. Once you've established cognitive parity, once they know you get it, other forms of language become acceptable. You can be moral. You can be emotional. But if you lead with emotional morality, you often don't get the chance to demonstrate that you actually understand the system. The filter catches you before you can prove you're worth listening to. Here's the defining difference between ordinary thinking and elite thinking. And once you see this, you can't unsee it. Time horizon. Most people think in outcomes. If we do X, then Y will happen. First order thinking, direct causation. Power thinks in feedback loops. If we do X, then Y will happen, which will cause Z, which will change the conditions that make X possible in the first place. They care less about what happens now than what happens after, what happens now, and what happens after that. This is why conversations with powerful people often feel frustrating if you're not used to it. You propose something that seems perfectly sensible. Then you nearly jump to some obscure downstream effect that seems paranoid. But if we do that, then six months from now, this other group will use it as precedent for something we definitely don't want. And you're thinking, why are you borrowing trouble from the future? Why can't we just deal with this now? The thing is, I've seen this pattern before. I know exactly where it leads. This is second door thinking, and it's non-negotiable for operating at elite levels. Let me give you a very specific example. So this is concrete. A tech company wants to ban certain content from its platform. First order thinking says this content is harmful. We should remove it. Simple. Direct. Done. Second order thinking says, okay, but if we remove it, we establish that we're responsible for content moderation. That creates liability. It also creates a precedent that other governments will use to demand we remove content we don't want to remove. It shifts us from platform to publisher legally. That changes our entire risk profile. Both levels of thinking might actually reach the same conclusion. They might both say remove the content, but only one of them is modeling the actual complexity. Only one of them sees the full system. If you cannot think beyond first order effects, you cannot be trusted with leverage. Because leverage amplifies consequences, and consequences compound over time. This is why powerful people seem to overthink everything. They're not overthinking. They're thinking at the appropriate level of complexity for the systems they're operating in. If you want access to those systems, you need to think at the same level. Not someday, not eventually, but right now, restraint. This is one of the most misunderstood elite signals. So we need to break it down carefully. Power does not rush. Simple as that. Why? Because it doesn't need to. Think about what rushing signals. When you rush, you signal scarcity of opportunity. When you over-explain, you signal insecurity.
 Overshare, you signal lack of discretion. When you over-optimize for this specific moment, you signal short-term thinking. Restraint can be something completely different. Restraint can be confidence in future positioning. Let me paint you a picture so we can visualize this. Imagine two people in the same meeting. Both are capable. Both have valuable insights to share. Person A jumps in immediately, explains their entire framework, offers to help, provides three examples, as if that makes sense, offers to send a follow-up document with more details. Person B waits, makes one precise observation at exactly the right moment, doesn't elaborate unless asked, doesn't offer anything, doesn't follow up unless it's actually relevant. Who seems more powerful? Who do you trust more? Person B every single time. Why? Because restraint signals abundance. It signals I have other options. I don't need to capture this opportunity right now. I can afford to wait. Now, this doesn't mean you should be passive. It doesn't mean you should be withholding or playing games. It means you should be calibrated. Say exactly as much as needed. No more, no less. Over-explaining signals that you think the other person doesn't understand, which is either insulting or indicates you don't understand your audience. Oversharing signals that you can't control information flow, which makes you unsuitable for sensitive environments. Over-optimizing signals that you're focused on this specific interaction rather than the long game, which makes you transactional rather than strategic. Restraint is hard. It's really hard because it requires genuine confidence. You have to actually believe that you'll have future opportunities. You have to actually trust that your value is evident without elaboration. Most people can't do this. They fill every silence. They explain every point three times. They offer more than what's asked for, and in doing so, they disqualify themselves. Silence is often a test. And I'm going to tell you right now, most people fail it. When power goes quiet, doesn't respond to your email, doesn't fill the pause in conversation, doesn't offer the reassurance you're looking for, they're observing. They're watching to see what you do. They're watching. Do you panic? Do you overcorrect? Do you fill the space unnecessarily? Do you make their silence about you? Let me tell you what usually happens, because I've seen this pattern hundreds of times. You send an email, no response. You wait three days, still nothing. So you send a follow-up. Just wanted to make sure you got my last email. Then another follow-up, circling back on this. Then you apologize for bothering them. Sorry to keep bugging you, but each message confirms that you misunderstood the test. Each one makes it worse. The silence wasn't rejection. It was measurement. They were seeing if you could tolerate uncertainty without destabilizing. You couldn't. Now contrast that with someone who sends one clear message and then waits. No follow-up, no anxiety, no making it mean something about their worth, just patience. That person just passed the test. Why does this matter so much? Because operating near power means tolerating enormous amounts of ambiguity. Deals fall through. Plans change. Priorities shift. If you can't handle radio silence without spiraling, you cannot handle the actual environment. You're showing them you'll be a liability. Silence is also a filter for status. And this is subtle but important. High-status people don't chase responses. They don't need immediate validation. They can afford to wait because they have other options. Their self-worth isn't tied to this one interaction. Low-status people panic in silence. They need to resolve the uncertainty immediately because they have no buffer. They have no other options. Power uses silence to sort between these two groups. So what should you do when power goes silent? What's the right move? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Continue executing on your own path. If they need you, they will resurface. If they don't, your follow-up wasn't going to change that anyway. Silence is only a problem if you need the other person's validation to function. If your structure is solid, silence is just silence. Power cares deeply about timing, obsessively even. And most people completely miss this. The same idea delivered at the wrong moment is useless. Completely useless. The same proposal delivered at the right moment is decisive. Changes everything. This is why powerful people value those who understand when not to speak. Because timing determines receptivity. Most people think the problem is getting their idea heard. They think if they just explain it clearly enough, loudly enough, persistently enough, it will land. But that's not how it works. Timing determines whether people are even capable of hearing you. An idea presented too early gets dismissed as premature. An idea presented too late gets dismissed as obvious. An idea presented at the wrong moment in a meeting gets dismissed as off-topic. Timing is contextual intelligence. It requires reading where attention is focused right now. What problems feel urgent at this exact moment? What's the shift in the environment? What emotional state the room is in? You can have the perfect solution to the wrong problem at the wrong time and it will land like a lead balloon. Here's a specific example. A company is in crisis mode. Revenue is down 20%. Everyone is stressed. People are worried about their jobs. Someone comes into a meeting and proposes a brilliant long-term strategy. It doesn't matter how brilliant it is. The timing is wrong. The organization is in short-term survival mode. Long-term thinking feels like a luxury they can't afford right now. The same exact proposal presented six months later when the crisis has stabilized gets adopted immediately. Nothing about the idea changed. Everything about the timing changed. This is why powerful people often seem to sit on information. They're not withholding. They're waiting. Waiting for the right moment when that information becomes actionable. When people are ready to hear it. Amateur operators push for immediate action. Professional operators wait for the right conditions. If you can't tell the difference between a good idea poorly timed and a bad idea, you don't understand how complex systems make decisions. And if you don't understand that power can trust you with strategic information. People constantly ask me this question. How can it be useful to powerful people and that question already contains a fatal flaw? The question itself is wrong. Power does not want helpers. It wants option creators. Let me explain the difference because this is crucial. Helpers execute defined tasks. I can do this for you. I can save you time. I can take this off your plate. That's the helper mindset. And that's useful. I'm not saying it's not useful. But it's also easily replaced. Anyone competent can execute defined tasks. You're not special. Option creators do something completely different. They expand strategic choices. They say, here's a path I don't think you've considered. Here's a constraint we could potentially remove. Here's a connection between two domains that opens new possibilities. You're valuable if you expand strategic choices, reduce uncertainty, and open new domains of action. Utility is about leverage, not labor. Think about it. Economically, labor is abundant. Strategic insight is rare. Execution capacity has to be commoditized. But the ability to see around corners? Priceless. So when you approach powerful people thinking, how can I-
 help them?" you're offering commodity services. When you approach thinking, "How can I expand their option space?" you're offering something they can't easily replicate. Let me give you a concrete example. So this isn't abstract. A startup founder meets an investor. Most founders pitch like this. "We're building X. We need funding. Can you invest?" That's asking the investor to provide capital, which is a commodity service the investor provides all the time. It's literally their job. Now imagine a different founder who says, "You invested in company A in this space. We're solving the infrastructure problem that company A will hit when they scale. Whether you invest in us or not, you should probably introduce us because it damages your existing debt." That founder just created optionality. They gave the investor a strategic choice they didn't know they had. Protect an existing investment by connecting two portfolio companies. Same conversation, completely different framing. One person is asking for help. The other is creating options. Direct value is easy to replace. That's the brutal truth you need to understand. If you show up offering to do tasks, write reports, make introductions, or provide standard services, someone else can do that. Maybe not as well as you, but well enough. You're replaceable. Indirect value is rare. It's irreplaceable. What does indirect value look like? It looks like connecting disparate domains nobody else saw as related. It looks like translating complexity into actionable insight. It looks like foreseeing conflicts before they surface. It looks like synthesizing patterns across unrelated fields. This kind of value cannot be requested. It must be demonstrated. You can't ask for it. It has to emerge from who you are and how you see the world. Let me give you an example from my own experience so you can see how this actually works. I once connected someone who ran a healthcare logistics company with someone who studied supply chain resilience in refugee camps. Neither of them asked for that introduction. Neither knew the other existed, but I saw that they were solving the same structural problem in wildly different contexts. Maintaining co-chain integrity under severe resource constraints. Same problem, different worlds. That introduction led to a collaboration that neither of them would have discovered on their own. I didn't provide labor. I provided synthesis. I connected dots that nobody else was connecting. That's indirect value. Here's why this matters so much. Direct value puts you in a transactional relationship. You do something, you get something back. The relationship is bounded by the transaction. It's limited. Indirect value creates ongoing strategic relevance. You're not a service provider. You're a sense-making node in the network. You make everything else work better. Power collects people who provide indirect value because those people make the entire network more valuable. They're multipliers, not additions. So stop asking, what can I do for you? Start asking, what patterns am I seeing that they're not seeing? What connections exist that nobody's made yet? The answer to that question is your actual value proposition, not your labor, your unique vantage point. Most people think access happens through introductions. If I could just get introduced to X, everything would change. That's backwards. Most meaningful connections to power happen through shared environments, not outreach. Environments like institutions, crisis, projects, negotiations, problem-solving contexts. Power trusts contexts that have already filtered participants. Think about it from their perspective. If someone sends you a code introduction, you have no idea if that person is confident, stable, or trustworthy. The introduction bounces for them. Sure, but the introducer might have bad judgment. But if you meet someone in a high-stakes environment where incompetence gets exposed quickly, you can observe them directly. You see how they handle pressure, how they think, whether they deliver. That's a much stronger signal than any introduction. This is why the most powerful people I know gather access through shared projects, not networking events. They work together on something real. They solve problems together. They earn trust through demonstrated performance in context. Let me give you a specific example. Two people want to access a particular CEO. Person A gets a warm introduction through a mutual friend. Person B ends up on a non-profit board that the CEO also serves on. Person A gets a polite coffee meeting. Person B gets months of watching the CEO operate in real decisions. And the CEO gets months of watching them. Guess who ends up with real access? This is why being present in the right environment does more than any introduction ever could. It's not about who you know. It's about what context you share. If you want access to power, don't focus on introductions. Focus on getting into environments where power is actively solving problems. Then solve those problems alongside them. Access follows performance in shared contexts. Not requests, not introductions, but shared struggle towards shared goals. Let me be blunt. Cold outreach almost never works for accessing power. Not because powerful people are mean, but because it bypasses all the filters they rely on. Power assumes if you were relevant, the system would have already surfaced you. This assumption is often wrong. There are plenty of capable people the system hasn't surfaced yet. But the assumption still governs behavior. The burden of proof is on the outsider, not the insider. Think about it from their position. They're already overwhelmed with opportunities from people who are being pre-filtered by institutions, mutual connections, or demonstrated performance. Why would they take a risk on someone who hasn't passed through any filtering mechanism? You think you're asking for a small favor, just 15 minutes of their time. They're thinking, if I say yes to this person, I have to say yes to a hundred others making the same ask. That's 25 hours of meetings with unbedded people. They can't do it. The math doesn't work. So they learn to default to no on cold outreach. Now, there are exceptions. Cold outreach works when you've created something undeniably valuable that speaks for itself. When you're solving a problem they're actively struggling with right now. When you have context-specific expertise they desperately need. Or when your message is so precisely targeted that it passes the signal filter. But notice, in every exception, you're not asking for something. You're offering something they already need. That's not networking. That's market demand. Most cold outreach fails because asking, not offering. It's requesting time, attention, advice, or access. All the things a powerful person doesn't have surplus of. If you want cold outreach to work, you need to flip the entire dynamic. You need to be offering something scarce that solves a current problem. Otherwise, you're just noise in an already overwhelming signal-to-noise environment. And noise gets filtered. Here's something that will save you years of wasted effort. Power bonds through shared problem spaces. Not through networking, not through rapport, but through coordination. That becomes necessary. When you're both trying to solve the same hard problem, connection happens naturally. Not because anyone scheduled it, but because the problem demands it. This is why the fastest path to power is not admiration. It's participation in real constraints. Let me paint you a picture. There's a regulatory change coming that affects an entire industry. Multiple companies need to coordinate the response. Someone sets up a working group. In that working group, people are not networking. They're solving a problem. But in the process of solving that problem, they observe who thinks clearly under pressure,
 Who has useful expertise. Who can be trusted with sensitive information. Those observations create connections far more powerful than any introduction. Why? Because you're forged in context. They're based on demonstrated capability, not self-presentation. Compare that to a networking event. At a networking event, you're presenting a curated version of yourself. You're performing competence. The other person has no way to verify if your performance matches reality. But in a shared problem space, there's nowhere to hide. Your thinking is either clear or it isn't. Your contributions either add value or they don't. Your reliability either holds up under pressure or doesn't. This is why I always tell people, if you want to connect with power or people in your industry, don't go to industry events. Go to the places where real problems are being solved. Find the working groups, the committees, the crisis response teams, the products that matter. Show up. Contribute. Solve problems. The connections will happen automatically because power recognizes competence in shared problem spaces far faster than it recognizes charm in artificial social settings. Now let me talk about something uncomfortable. Moral grandstanding. Moral grandstanding is one of the fastest ways to lose credibility with power. Not because power is immoral, but because power operates in tragic trade-offs. Let me explain what I mean by tragic trade-offs. A tragic trade-off is when every available option has serious downsides. There is no good choice. Only choices with different distributions of harm. You're not choosing between right and wrong, you're choosing between bad and worse. People who cannot tolerate more ambiguity are liabilities in these situations. Here's a specific example. A company has to choose between layoffs now or bankruptcy in six months. Bankruptcy means everyone loses their job. Layoffs mean some people lose their jobs today. There is no morally clean option. Both involve real harm to real people. Someone who says we should never do layoffs because people have families is not being moral. They're being simplistic. They're refusing to engage with the actual constraint. The person who says layoffs are terrible and we need to minimize harm while preserving the company's ability to survive so the remaining employees keep their jobs, that person is engaging with reality. Same values, completely different level of sophistication. Now, this doesn't mean power is immoral. It means power is consequentialist. Consequentialism means you're responsible for the outcomes of your choices, not just your intentions. Noble intentions don't absolve you if your choices make things worse. This is why moral language often backfires. It signals that you're thinking deontologically about rules and principles rather than consequentially about outcomes and trade-offs. In high-stakes environments where the cost of mistakes are enormous, power needs people who think consequentially. If you cannot tolerate more ambiguity, you cannot operate in complex systems, and power has no use for people who can't operate in an environment where power actually functions. This doesn't mean abandoning your values. It means learning to apply them in contexts where every choice has cost. Let's talk about the behaviors that guarantee rejection no matter how talented you are. Name-dropping. When you drop names to establish credibility, you signal that you don't have organic credibility. You're borrowing status instead of demonstrating value. Performative intelligence, using jargon unnecessarily, referencing obscure concepts to sound smart, explaining things people already understand. All this signals insecurity masked as competence. Exaggerated certainty, claiming to have all the answers, refusing to acknowledge uncertainty, dismissing alternative views. This signals you haven't spent time in complex environments where certainty is rare. Ideological rigidity, turning every issue into a battle between your worldview and others, refusing to engage with perspectives you disagree with. This signals your liability in pluralistic environments. These behaviors have something in common. They all signal insecurity, not competence. And here's what you need to understand. Power avoids volatility more than incompetence. An incompetent person who's stable can be managed. They can be given valid tasks. They can be walked around. A competent person who is volatile is dangerous. They create unpredictable problems. They can be contained. They're a risk to the entire system. So when you signal volatility through any of these anti-signals, you trigger immune responses. It doesn't matter how smart you are. It doesn't matter how capable you are. If you seem volatile, you're out. Let me give you specific examples. I've seen someone in a meeting constantly references their credentials. When I was at Harvard, in my experience at McKenzie, every sentence is a status claim. That person is signaling, I'm worried you won't respect me, so I'm going to keep reminding you of my achievements. Power hears this person is insecure and will be exhausting to manage. Another person dismisses every idea that isn't theirs. That won't work, because we tried that already. That's not how it's done. That person thinks they're demonstrating expertise. Power hears this person can collaborate and will create friction on every team there are. These anti-signals are death sentences. Even if you're brilliant, they disqualify you because power is optimizing for system stability, not individual genius. Discretion is non-negotiable. Let me be completely clear about this. Power assumes that anyone who overshares, leaks narratives, or seeks visibility cannot be trusted near sensitive information. Silence is not emptiness. It's containment. Think about what happens when someone shares private information publicly. Maybe they're trying to build credibility. Maybe they're trying to seem important. Maybe they don't realize what they're doing. It doesn't matter. The moment they demonstrate they can't contain information, they disqualify themselves from ever being trusted with important information again. This is why you see powerful people being incredibly careful about what they say publicly. It's not just legal liability, though that's part of it. It's that they've learned that discretion is a prerequisite for operating at certain levels. Let me give you concrete examples of discretion failures. Posting on social media about meetings you've had with important people, that signals I value the status boost more than I value discretion. Sharing confidential information to seem knowledgeable, that signals I cannot be trusted with sensitive information. Name-dropping in casual conversation, that signals I don't understand boundaries talking publicly about private dynamics. That signals I will create liability if included in sensitive situations. Each of these seems minor in isolation, but they all point to the same underlying issue and inability to contain information and power has learned that information containment failures scale. If you can't keep small things private, you definitely can't keep big things private. So, they shut you out preemptively. Now here's what's tricky about this. Many people think being authentic means sharing everything. Being transparent means having no filters. Being real means talking about what's actually happening. In pure relationships, that might work. In proximity to power is disqualifying because power operates in environments where information is currency and currency needs to be protected. If you can't protect information, you can't participate in those environments. Here's something most people don't realize. Power often knows of you long before you meet it. Your reputation travels through institutional memory, informal networks, and past behavior.
 pressure. You are being evaluated even when you are not present. This has profound implications. It means every interaction you have with anyone is potentially being observed by proxy. Not because people are spying on you, but because people talk. They share notes. They warn each other. Let me give you a specific example. Someone treats a junior employee badly. They assume it doesn't matter because that person has no power. But that junior employee knows other junior employees who know senior employees who know executives. Six months later, our protagonist is trying to access an executive. The executive asks around, does anyone know this person? Someone says, yeah, my colleague worked with them. Horrible experience. Very disrespectful. That reputation arrives before the person does. They never get the meeting. They never know why. This is why I tell people there's no such thing as unimportant interactions. Every person you interact with is a potential vector for your reputation. How you treat people when you have nothing to gain from them reveals who you actually are. And that information propagates. Now the flip side is also true. If you consistently demonstrate competence, integrity, and good judgment, even in situations where nobody important is watching, that reputation propagates too. I've seen people get opportunities they didn't apply for because someone said, I worked with them three years ago on something minor and I was impressed by how they handled it. That's reputation working in your favor. But here's the key. You cannot manufacture this. You cannot fake it. Your reputation is the sum of all your behaviors over time. And that information moves through networks faster than you do. So the only viable strategy is to actually be the person you want to be known as. Not when it's convenient all the time, because you never know which interaction is going to defy how you're remembered. People often think power is exclusive because powerful people are elitist or protective of their status. That's usually not it. Power is exclusive because inclusion increases risk. Let me explain the math. Every additional node in a network introduces unpredictability, leakage, and coordination costs. Unpredictability means you don't know how this new person will behave under pressure. You don't know if they'll panic, fold, or escalate. Leakage means you don't know if this person will contain sensitive information or broadcast it. You don't know who they're connected to or what incentives they have. Coordination costs means every additional person in a decision-making process makes that process slower and more complex. More meetings, more alignment, more potential for conflict. So exclusivity is not about ego, it's about physics. Smaller networks can move fast. They can maintain confidentiality. They can make decisions without bureaucracy. Large networks slow down. Information leaks. Coordination becomes expensive. This is why power keeps circles small. Not because they're elitist, but because larger circles become unmanageable. Think about your own life. When you need to make a difficult personal decision, do you consult 50 people? No. You talk to two or three people you deeply trust. Why? Because more opinions don't make the decision better, they make it harder. The same principle applies at scale. Power is not excluding you because you're unworthy. Power is excluding you because every inclusion has costs, and those costs compound. This is why complaining about gatekeeping misunderstands the underlying dynamic. The gates aren't there to keep you out personally. They're there because systems need boundaries to function. If you walk inside, you need to reduce the cost of your inclusion. You need to be predictable so they can model your behavior. You need to be discreet so you don't create leakage risk. You need to be self-sufficient so you don't increase coordination costs. When the costs of including you are lower than the benefits, inclusion happens naturally. Here's the central paradox. The more directly you seek access to power, the less suitable you appear for it. Let me explain why. When you directly seek access, you're signaling, I need this. That need creates dependency. And as we've already established, dependency repels power. But there's something deeper happening here. Direct seeking also signals that you don't understand how power actually flows. You think it's about asking the right person for permission. You think it's about getting in the room. Power knows that actual power doesn't work that way. Actual power accretes to people who are solving problems that matter. It accretes to people who are creating value that the system needs. It accretes to people who are becoming systemically necessary. Those people don't seek access. They become unavoidable. Power responds to inevitability, not desire. Think about any powerful person you know who started from nothing. Did they get there by asking powerful people for permission? Or did they build something the system could ignore? They made themselves necessary. Then access followed. This is the paradox. You get access by not seeking it. You get access by becoming someone whose absence will create problems. Let me give you a concrete example. Two people want to access a particular investor. Person A, which is just an investor, crafts the perfect cold email, asks for an introduction to three different mutual connections, follows up strategically. Person B builds a company in a space the investor is already invested in, creates a product that solves a problem for the investor's existing portfolio companies, and casually mentions they exist. Person A is seeking access. Person B is creating necessity. Guess who gets the meeting? The person who didn't ask for it. Because the investor's choice became, do I meet with them or do I let my portfolio companies remain vulnerable to a problem I could help solve? That's structural inevitability, and it's the only thing that actually works. So let's talk about what structural inevitability actually means, because this is the entire game. Structural inevitability means your role is necessary. Your absence creates friction. Your presence solves problems. At that point, access stops being granted. It becomes required. Let me break this down with specific examples. Imagine you're an expert in a regulatory domain that's about to affect an entire industry. You understand the new rules better than anyone. You've published clear analysis. You've built tools to help companies comply. Now, a major player in that industry needs to navigate those regulations. Do they need to like you? No. Do they need to respect you? Yes. But that's downstream of utility. Do they need to access you? Absolutely. Your expertise has made you structurally necessary for their problem. Access follows automatically. Or imagine you build relationships across three different organizations that need to coordinate. You're the only person who understands all three cultures, all three incentive structures, all three decision-making processes. A crisis hits that requires coordination. You're not the most senior person. You're not the most credentialed person, but you're the only person who can facilitate the necessary coordination. You become structurally inevitable. Access isn't granted. It's required. Now, here's what's crucial. You cannot fake this. You cannot shortcut it. Becoming structurally inevitable requires developing genuine expertise or capability, making that expertise visible in contexts that matter, and solving problems that create dependencies. This takes time. It takes work. There's no networking hack that bypasses it. But here's the beautiful thing. Once you've achieved it, you never have to seek access again. The system pulls you in because excluding you
 That's the difference between access that's granted and access that's inevitable. One can be revoked, the other can't. Let's address something that frustrates everyone. This process is slow. Becoming structurally inevitable doesn't happen in weeks or even months. It takes years. And that delay is not a bug. It's a feature. Power selection is slow by design. Here's why. Speed increases error. Error increases risk. If power let people in quickly, they let in volatility, instability, and people who haven't been tested under pressure. So they wait. They watch. They let time do the filtering. Time reveals whether you're consistent or erratic, whether you deliver or overpromise, whether you're stable or fragile, whether you're genuinely capable or just well-presented. You cannot fake consistency over time. You cannot fake sustained performance. You cannot fake stability under extended pressure. That's why time is the ultimate filter. If you feel frustrated by the pace, you're still thinking emotionally rather than structurally. Emotional thinking says, I'm ready now. I'm capable now. Why won't they let me in? Structural thinking says, the system needs to observe me over time to reduce risk. That's rational. I'll keep performing while the observation happens. The second person gets in eventually. The first person gives up or burns out. Here's what I want you to understand. The slowness is protecting you, too. If you got access before you were ready, before you developed the capabilities, the mental models, the emotional resilience to operate in that environment, you'd fail. And failure at higher levels is more consequential. The time delay is the system's way of ensuring that when you do get access, you can actually handle it. So instead of following the timeline, use it. Use the time to develop deeper expertise, build real track record, strengthen your mental models, establish reputation, become genuinely necessary. By the time access arrives, you won't need it anymore. You'll become powerful enough yourself that you're selecting which opportunities to take. That's when you know the process worked. If you remember nothing else from this entire lecture, remember this. Power does not connect to ambition. It connects to alignment. Let me explain what that means. Ambition is about what you want. Alignment is about what's necessary. Ambitious people say, I want to be important. I want to be powerful. I want access to powerful people. Aligned people say, here's a problem that matters. Here's my role in solving it. Here's why my participation is necessary. Power ignores the first group and recruits the second. Why? Because ambition is abundant. Everyone is ambitious. Ambition doesn't differentiate you. It just makes you one of thousands of people wanting the same thing. Alignment is rare. Alignment means you understand the system well enough to see where you actually fit, where your capabilities match system needs, where your presence solves real problems. So here's what I'm telling you to do. Stop trying to be impressive. Stop trying to be visible. Stop trying to get meetings. Stop trying to network your way in. Instead, develop genuine capabilities. Understand the systems you want to operate in. Solve problems that create dependencies. Make your value evident through demonstrated performance. Build reputation through consistency over time. Become structurally unavoidable. When you do that, access will follow. Not because you asked for it, not because you impressed someone, not because you work effectively, but because the system had no other choice. You solved a problem they couldn't solve without you. You filled a gap they couldn't fill otherwise. You became necessary. And necessity trumps every other consideration. That's the only strategy that actually works. Everything else is just...
