# MVP2 — Mural Sticky Notes
## System-Level Framing: Intake Classification as a Strategic Filter

---

## 🟥 CLUSTER 1 — The Core Problem Statement
*Red stickies — problem framing*

1. An unclassified backlog cannot be prioritized. It can only be ordered.
2. Ordering by recency, urgency, or political weight is not prioritization. It is queue management.
3. Without classification, the organization has no way to know if its intake pipeline is serving its strategic objectives — or simply processing whatever arrives loudest.
4. The portfolio is whatever the queue produced — not what strategic intent would have produced.

---

## 🟨 CLUSTER 2 — The Visibility Asymmetry
*Yellow stickies — why it persists*

5. At the reviewer level, prioritization feels like judgment. Reviewers assess submissions against their personal understanding of current priorities. This does not scale and produces inconsistent outcomes.
6. At the portfolio level, the aggregate effect of unclassified intake is a portfolio composition that nobody designed.
7. Leadership sees a list of approved work. They cannot see what fraction is net-new versus Epic extensions, whether it is OKR-aligned, or whether AI submissions went through the right governance lens.
8. OKR-aligned work gets crowded out by high-volume operational requests — not because it was deprioritized deliberately, but because no classification mechanism surfaced its alignment.
9. Teams create new Epics for problem spaces that already have active Epics — because no one classified the submission against the existing portfolio structure.
10. The portfolio composition problem is invisible because unclassified submissions all look the same in a queue.

## 🟦 CLUSTER 3 — What Prioritization Actually Requires
*Blue stickies — the real resource impact*

11. Prioritization requires three inputs: what kind of work is this, does existing work already own this problem space, and does this serve a current OKR with a team that has capacity to absorb it.
12. Without work type classification, a reviewer cannot route a submission correctly, apply the right governance criteria, or compare it meaningfully against other submissions.
13. Without portfolio position, a reviewer cannot know if they are approving a net-new initiative or a duplicate effort in different vocabulary.
14. Without OKR alignment signals, a reviewer cannot hold the intake process accountable to strategic priorities. OKRs govern planning documents — not what actually gets built.
15. Without capacity signals, approved submissions route to teams that cannot absorb them — creating backlog aging, coordination overhead, and no output.
16. Prioritization without these inputs is scheduling. Classification is what makes genuine prioritization possible.

## 🟩 CLUSTER 4 — The Portfolio Governance Frame
*Green stickies — executive reframe*

17. Portfolio composition is a governance concern. If the intake pipeline produces work that does not align to strategic priorities, the failure is at intake — not in execution.
18. OKR accountability requires classification. You cannot audit OKR alignment in the intake pipeline if submissions are not classified against OKRs at submission time.
19. Capacity governance requires routing. You cannot govern team capacity if submissions are not routed by work type to the team that will own them.
20. The OKR framework is only as effective as the classification layer that connects intake submissions to it. Without classification, OKRs are planning artifacts — not operational filters.
21. MVP2 is not a tagging exercise. It is the governance mechanism that makes the intake pipeline answerable to strategic intent.
22. With classification, what gets approved is what serves current priorities, fits existing portfolio structure, and teams can actually absorb — not whatever arrived most recently.

## 🟧 CLUSTER 5 — One-Liners by Audience
*Orange stickies — how to say it in the room*

23. TO AN EXECUTIVE: "You cannot govern portfolio composition without classification. Right now the portfolio is whatever the queue produced — not what strategic intent would have produced."
24. TO A VP: "Your OKR framework governs what gets written in planning documents, not what actually gets built — because intake submissions are not classified against OKRs at submission time."
25. TO A PROGRAM MANAGER: "You are prioritizing submissions without knowing what type of work they are, what Epic they belong under, or whether the team that would own them has capacity. Classification gives you all three."
26. TO A REVIEWER: "Instead of assessing submissions cold, you will receive them with work type, portfolio position, and OKR signals already assembled — so your review time is spent on evaluation, not reconstruction."

## ⬜ CLUSTER 6 — The Anchor Statement
*White sticky — pin to center of the board*

27. "Right now, the intake pipeline does not know what kind of work it is processing. A net-new AI initiative and a feature request on an existing Epic and a data report and a support ticket all enter the same queue and compete for the same review attention — with no structural information connecting them to our OKRs, our portfolio structure, or our capacity constraints. That is not prioritization. That is ordering by volume and urgency. MVP2 is the classification layer that converts intake from a queue into a strategic filter — so that what gets approved is what serves current priorities, fits existing portfolio structure, and the teams responsible for it can actually absorb."
