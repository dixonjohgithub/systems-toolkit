# MVP0 — Mural Sticky Notes
## System-Level Framing: Intake Quality as a Portfolio Governance Problem

---

## 🟥 CLUSTER 1 — The Core Problem Statement
*Red stickies — problem framing*

1. Intake quality is not a form problem. It is a portfolio governance problem.
2. Every low-quality submission consumes organizational capacity — not on evaluation, but on information retrieval.
3. The cost of poor quality is paid by the people above the submitter — and invisible to everyone with authority to fix it.
4. A system with no feedback on quality will reproduce inconsistent quality. Not because people are careless. Because the system gives them no signal that quality matters.

## 🟨 CLUSTER 2 — The Visibility Asymmetry
*Yellow stickies — why it persists*

5. At the reviewer level, a clarification cycle is Tuesday. It is part of the job. There is no flag. No penalty. No attribution.
6. The submitter never knows their incomplete intake created cost downstream. Nothing in the system tells them.
7. The intake designer never knows their form is generating low-quality submissions. Nothing in the system tells them.
8. Leadership never sees "intake quality problem." They see slow queues, overwhelmed reviewers, stalled initiatives.
9. The root cause is invisible because intake quality events and review capacity consumption events are never connected.
10. The absence of a penalty mechanism is not neutral. It means the system has no feedback loop — and will keep producing the same result.

## 🟦 CLUSTER 3 — What Review Capacity Actually Costs
*Blue stickies — the real resource impact*

11. Senior reviewers, committee members, and executives sitting on intake panels are not cheap capacity.
12. When review capacity is spent on information retrieval, it is not available for evaluation and decision.
13. Reviewers hold incomplete submissions in working memory for days or weeks while waiting for clarification responses.
14. At some point the clarification cycle ends not with a complete submission — but with a "good enough" one. Decisions get made on less information than they should.
15. 120+ active intake processes. Hundreds of in-flight submissions. The aggregate misallocation is not a minor inefficiency.
16. The cost is real and aggregate — but absorbed locally and silently at every level before it reaches anyone who could address it.

## 🟩 CLUSTER 4 — The Portfolio Governance Frame
*Green stickies — executive reframe*

17. The resource is review capacity. It is finite, expensive, and the limiting factor in how fast the portfolio can move.
18. The allocation is wrong. A fraction of review capacity is being spent on information retrieval instead of evaluation.
19. The misallocation is invisible. Because no reporting system connects the intake quality event to the downstream capacity event.
20. The fix is upstream. The only lever that works at the system level is ensuring submissions enter the review chain complete and actionable.
21. Quality is not a nice-to-have. It is a hard prerequisite for portfolio efficiency.
22. MVP0 is not a UX improvement for submitters. It is a governance mechanism that protects the organization's most expensive review capacity.

## 🟧 CLUSTER 5 — One-Liners by Audience
*Orange stickies — how to say it in the room*

23. TO AN EXECUTIVE: "Your most expensive review capacity is being spent on information retrieval, not evaluation. MVP0 fixes the upstream source."
24. TO A VP: "Reviewers absorb a cost that has no feedback mechanism. The submitter never knows. Nothing changes. MVP0 creates the signal."
25. TO A PROGRAM MANAGER: "You cannot measure throughput accurately when a fraction of every review engagement is untracked information retrieval."
26. TO A REVIEWER: "The back-and-forth you do today to get a submission actionable — every intake you receive will have already cleared that bar before it reaches you."

## ⬜ CLUSTER 6 — The Anchor Statement
*White sticky — pin to center of the board*

27. "Right now, a portion of our intake review capacity — the attention of the people we most need focused on portfolio decisions — is being consumed by clarification cycles on incomplete submissions. That cost is paid silently, locally, and without attribution at every level of the review chain. It never appears on a report. It never triggers a flag. It compounds. MVP0 is the governance layer that moves the quality bar upstream — so review capacity is spent on evaluation, not on information retrieval."
